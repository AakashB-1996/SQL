with sub as (select
x, lead(x,1) over(order by x) as px
from Point)

select min(abs(x-px)) as shortest from sub

##Using Joins

select min(abs(l.x-r.x)) as shortest from Point l join Point r on l.x != r.x

Table: Point

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, x is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-axis.
 

Find the shortest distance between any two points from the Point table.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Point table:
+----+
| x  |
+----+
| -1 |
| 0  |
| 2  |
+----+
Output: 
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1        |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is between points -1 and 0 which is |(-1) - 0| = 1.
